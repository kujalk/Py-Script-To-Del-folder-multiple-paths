Python script to search and delete a unique folder that is available in multiple paths
***************************************************************************************

Assume a folder named "cache" is found inside multiple locations
"C:\Training\Users\User1\App\Cache"
"C:\Training\Users\User2\App\App1\Cache"
"C:\Training\Users\User3\Cache"
"C:\Training\Users\User3\App\Cache"
"C:\Training\Users\User4\App\Different\Cache"

So it's a hectic process to search and delete that particular folder "cache" in multiple path locations.

So I have developed a python script, to search and delete that unique folder named "cache" in multiple paths.

In the script, I have taken 3 user inputs,
1. A "Common root path" to reach different multiple sub paths
   For example, in the above given paths, upto this path "C:\Training\Users" everything is same. So the
   user need to pass this as a parameter without any quotes. 
2. The unique folder name that needs to be deleted completely.
   For example, in the above scenario, its "cache" folder
3. A place to store log file. 
   For example, D:\scripts\log.txt

Just dive into the script now,

In order to remove certain folders, the user must have some privileges rights to it. Therefore before start executing the script, the must
needs to run the script as different user.In order to do it, right click the cmd with shift key and click on "Run as different user". In order
to remember this to user, I have put a message as,
reply = input ("\nDid you use your Privilege Account to run this script\n  If yes press 'y' if not press 'n'\n : ")

I have used os.walk(), to traverse across multiple paths and used fnmatch.filter(), to filter the paths that contain only unique 
folder name that needs to be deleted. Then I used (os.path.join(root,name) to create the absolute path of the folders to be deleted.
I am putting every results into the list variable called mylist[] .
for root,dirs,files in os.walk(Firstpath):
		for name in fnmatch.filter(dirs,Search):
			mylist.append((os.path.join(root,name)))

Then I looped into "mylist" list and removed the required folder "cache" using shutil.rmtree().
for delete in mylist:
	shutil.rmtree(delete)
	timestamp ("Removed "+delete)
